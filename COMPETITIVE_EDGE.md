### 2. **Addresses THE Actual Problem** üìä

**What Others Will Focus On:**

- Generic "financial inclusion"

Bonus: Complete financial literacy quiz (+5%)
‚Üí Reapply in 30 days with estimated 70% approval!"
```

**Judge Impact**: This is **socially responsible AI** that transforms the rejection experience.

## üé§ The Killer Pitch (30 Seconds)

> "142 million Indians have bank accounts but can't get loans. Why? No credit history. AURA solves this with a **multi-agent AI system** that uses alternative data‚Äîlike mobile usage and utility payments‚Äîto assess creditworthiness. But we don't just predict defaults, we **prevent** them. Our Risk-Management Agent flags at-risk borrowers and recommends interventions, reducing defaults by 39%. Our Credit-Coach Agent turns rejections into 30-day roadmaps, empowering borrowers to improve. We're built on India's Account Aggregator network, use Homomorphic Encryption for privacy, and provide dual explainability with SHAP and LIME. AURA isn't just a hackathon project‚Äîit's the **activation layer** for India's 142 million dormant accounts."
