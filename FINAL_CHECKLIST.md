Our Risk-Management Agent prevents defaults before they happen, reducing them by 39%. Our Credit-Coach Agent transforms rejections into 30-day roadmaps, empowering borrowers to build creditworthiness. We're built on India's Account Aggregator network, use Homomorphic Encryption for privacy, and provide dual explainability with SHAP and LIME. AURA addresses a $5.7 trillion global financing gap."

- [x] SHAP + LIME (dual explainability for B2B + B2C)
- [x] 39% default reduction, 25-35% credit improvement
- [x] Empowerment over exclusion

### Q&A Preparation ‚úÖ

- [x] "How is this different?" ‚Üí Agentic AI + alternative data + dual-sided
