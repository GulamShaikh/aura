## 🎤 PITCH PREPARATION (If Presenting)

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"AURA is an Agentic AI system that solves India's financial inclusion crisis. We use alternative data—like mobile usage and utility payments—to predict defaults before they happen. Our dual-agent system both helps lenders reduce defaults by 39% AND coaches borrowers to improve their creditworthiness. It's not just ML prediction—it's autonomous action."

### Key Demo Points (3 minutes)

1. **The Problem** (30 sec)

   - 70% of Indians lack credit access
   - Traditional scoring fails without credit history

2. **Risk-Management Agent** (60 sec)

   - Show portfolio dashboard
   - Highlight proactive alerts
   - Point out specific recommendations
   - Explain ethical defaulter intelligence

3. **Credit-Coach Agent** (60 sec)

   - Select a borrower profile
   - Show personalized coaching plan
   - Emphasize empowerment, not punishment
   - Mobile-accessible design

4. **Innovation** (30 sec)
   - Alternative data sources
   - Agentic AI vs passive ML
   - Privacy-preserving design
   - Impact: 39% default reduction

### Questions You Might Get

**Q: "How is this different from existing credit scoring?"**
A: Traditional scoring relies on credit history that doesn't exist. We use alternative data everyone has—mobile usage, utility payments. Plus, we're agentic—we don't just predict, we autonomously recommend specific actions.

**Q: "What about privacy concerns with this data?"**
A: We simulate Homomorphic Encryption, which allows ML inference on encrypted data. Users never expose raw information. In production, we'd use TenSEAL or Microsoft SEAL. Plus, transparent consent and data minimization.

**Q: "How do you monetize?"**
A: SaaS model for lenders (₹10-20 per user/month). Freemium app for borrowers (free coaching, premium features). Proven willingness to pay—lenders save millions on defaults.

**Q: "Why Random Forest over deep learning?"**
A: Explainability. Financial decisions need transparency. Random Forest gives us feature importance, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and user trust. Plus, it's fast and works well with tabular data.

**Q: "What about bias in the model?"**
A: We use diverse training data, monitor for fairness metrics, and provide explainability. The Credit-Coach Agent helps borrowers improve their profiles, reducing systemic disadvantage. Ethical AI is core to our design.
