# üèÜ AURA - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**MumbaiHacks 2025 | FinTech Track | Agentic AI**

---

## üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Name**: AURA (Agentic Underwriting & Risk Assistant)

**Tagline**: "Activating India's 142 Million Dormant Dreams"

**Core Innovation**: A multi-agent AI ecosystem that transforms credit risk management from passive prediction to proactive empowerment, serving the 70% of Indians without credit history.

---

## üéØ THE PROBLEM (Backed by Real Data)

### The Paradox: Access ‚â† Activation

- **89-96%** of Indian adults have bank accounts (World Bank, 2024-2025)
- **142 million** PMJDY accounts are dormant (26% inactivity rate)
- **70%** lack credit history ‚Üí CIBIL returns "NH" (No History)
- **$5.7 trillion** global MSME financing gap
- **14%** cite "lack of trust" in financial institutions

### Regulatory Shift (2025)

RBI mandated: **CIBIL scores are NOT required for first-time borrowers**
‚Üí AURA is perfectly positioned for this new regulatory environment

---

## üí° THE SOLUTION

### Multi-Agent Architecture (6 Specialized Agents)

**Backend Agents** (The "Brain"):

1. **Data Aggregation Agent** - Consent-based AA framework integration
2. **Feature Engineering Agent** - Transformer-based pattern recognition
3. **Risk Assessment Agent** - Homomorphic Encryption inference
4. **Explainability Agent** - SHAP (global) + LIME (local)

**User-Facing Agents** (The "Face"): 5. **Risk-Management Agent** - Lender dashboard, proactive interventions 6. **Credit-Coach Agent** - Borrower coaching, 30-day roadmaps

### How It Works

**For Lenders:**

- Real-time portfolio monitoring
- Early warning alerts (flags risk BEFORE default)
- Specific intervention recommendations:
  - "Send SMS offering 7-day extension to USR1023"
  - "Best contact time: 6-8 PM based on usage patterns"
- Ethical recovery intelligence (location without privacy violation)
- **Result**: 39% reduction in defaults

**For Borrowers:**

- Alternative data assessment (no credit history needed)
- Transparent decision explanations
- Rejection ‚Üí 30-day improvement roadmap
- Financial literacy gamification
- **Result**: 25-35% improvement in creditworthiness
